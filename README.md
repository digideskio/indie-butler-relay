Indie Butler Relay
====================

The relay side of the Indie Butler. 

Since this is a nodejs based app, you can deploy it like you would deploy any other node app. It doesn't have any other software 
requirement...
It works on Heroku (but uses xhr-polling), as well as nodejitsu.


To do
-----

* Allow for some kind of auth mechanism so that when someone claims a URL, only them can do so.
* Write more implementations,on other stacks.
